Todrick Hall Lyrics
"Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels"

Nails, hair, hips, heels
Ass, fat, lips, real
Purse, full, big, bills
Bitch I'm a big deal

Legs, legs, face, eyes
Thin waist, thick thighs
You, me, you wish
New phone, who this

Pussy puss, puss give them cunt cunt cunt bitch
Mama yes god and you pop that tongue bitch
This whole club is my runway run bitch
Y'all 5 4 3 2s I'm a 1 bitch

Girl, what did that girl just say, girl?
(Ooh girl)

I don't dance I work
I don't play I slay
I don't walk I strut, strut, strut and then sashay
OK

But I don't work for free
No
That's not the tea hunty
No ma'am
So make it rain on me
And I might let you see

What you gonna let them see?
